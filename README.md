# hello-world
this is my first creation of a repository, solely for learning purposes
I just changed the word "demonstration" to the word "learning" in the line above... I tend to over think things, but I think that's a good thing Ha!... Maybe I need to redirect my brain power and overthink the "right" things... ooohhh
Here I am, trying to see how this commit stuff works
